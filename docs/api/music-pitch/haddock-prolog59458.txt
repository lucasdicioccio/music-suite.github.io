This package provides various representations of musical pitch.

Note that this package is independent of @music-score@ and vice versa.
This is a deliberate design choice: the user should be free to combine any
pitch representation with any time structure. Normally you will include
both packages through @music-preludes@.

This library is part of the Music Suite, see
<http://music-suite.github.io>.
