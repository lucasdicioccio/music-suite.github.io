## The Music Suite

The Music Suite is a language based on [Haskell][Haskell] for creating, processing or analyzing music. It can be used on its own or as a Haskell library.

The Music Suite is designed to:

* Describe what the music *is*, rather than how it is to be performed.
* Avoid imposing stylistic or theoretical assumptions on the music.
* Include common notation and theory as a *special case*.
* Allow customization of the music representation.

The Music Suite is both an *embedded* language and a Haskell library. Being embedded in Haskell has several advantages, it allow the developers to focus on the contents and the users to make use of any feature in the Haskell language.

The Music Suite uses several advanced language constructs internally and requires a relatively new Haskell compiler (see [Installing the Suite](#installing-the-suite)).


### An example

To generate music we write an *expressions* such as this one:

<div class='haskell-music'>

```haskell
let
    m = staccato (scat [c,d,e,c]^/2) |> ab |> b_ |> legato (d |> c)^*2
in stretch (1/8) m

```

</div>

To transform music, we write a *function*. For example the following function halves all durations and transposes all pitches up a minor sixth:

```haskell
up (minor sixth) . compress 2

```

Applied to the above music we get:

### Input and output

The Music Suite works well with the following input and output formats:

* MusicXML
* Lilypond
* ABC notation
* MIDI

### A note on the versioning

The Music Suite consists of a group of packages released concurrently under a common [semantic version number](http://semver.org/). The library was deliberately released *prematurely* in order to encourage its creator to work on it more: we expect the first truly stable version to be *2.0*.
