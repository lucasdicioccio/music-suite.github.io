The Music Suite is a language for creating, processing or analyzing music. It is based on [Haskell][Haskell], the world's greatest functional programming language^[In fact it is a so-called embedded domain-specific language, see http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Embedded_domain_specific_language].

The Music Suite is designed to:

* Be usable with any kind of music. There are no stylistic or theoretical assumptions on how music should be described.
* It should include standard notation as a *special case*. 



### An example

To generate music we write an *expressions* such as this one:

<div class='haskell-music'>

```haskell
let
    m = staccato (scat [c,d,e,c]^/2) |> ab |> b_ |> legato (d |> c)^*2
in stretch (1/8) m

```

</div>

To transform music, we write a *function*. For example the following function halves all durations and transposes all pitches up a minor sixth:

```haskell
up (minor sixth) . compress 2

```

Applied to the above music we get:

### Input and output

The Music Suite works well with the following input and output formats:

* MusicXML
* Lilypond
* ABC notation
* MIDI
