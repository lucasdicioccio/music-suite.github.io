The Music Suite is a language for representing, creating, transforming or analyzing music, based on [Haskell][Haskell]. 

The Music Suite is designed to:

* Be usable with various types of music. It should allow custom representation of time, pitch, dynamics and so on.

* It should include standard notation as a *special case*, including a full representation of time, pitch, rhythm, dynamics, articulation, part structure, and so on. 



### An example

To generate music we write an *expressions* such as this one:

<div class='haskell-music'>

```haskell
let
    m = staccato (scat [c,d,e,c]^/2) |> ab |> b_ |> legato (d |> c)^*2
in stretch (1/8) m

```

</div>

To transform music, we write a *function*. For example the following function halves all durations and transposes all pitches up a minor sixth:

```haskell
up (minor sixth) . compress 2

```

Applied to the above music we get:

### Input and output

The Music Suite works well with the following input and output formats:

* MusicXML
* Lilypond
* ABC notation
* MIDI
